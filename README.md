What we did:
Compare effectiveness of various machine learning modelsâ€™ ability to predict stock prices

Purpose:To predict if the price of an individual stock will go up or down based on technical indicators and either buy or sell that stock for a particular timeline.

Hypothesis:
LSTM model would have the highest accuracy since its neural network is excellent for regression problems and widely used by automated AI traders.
